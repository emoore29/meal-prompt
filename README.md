# Meal Prompt

Semi-randomly combines ingredients from major food groups into a meal prompt.

The goal is to give the user ideas, not to suggest a perfect meal.

Complimentary ingredients and favourited ingredients will be suggested more frequently.

Only seasonal fruits and vegetables will be suggested.

User can add, edit, remove, and favourite ingredients, and add complimentary ingredients.

If an ingredient has complimentary ingredients, those are more likely to be included together in the prompt.

Food groups, sweet, and savoury, are loosely defined. The original lists are based on my preferences and how I tend to use certain ingredients.
