# Meal Prompt

Interactive shell that allows users to edit a database of food ingredients, and request a "meal prompt". 

A meal prompt is a set of randomly selected ingredients from the following food groups: fruit, vegetable, carb, fat, protein.

The user can view and edit the database from which the ingredients are selected.

The goal is to give the user ideas, not to suggest a perfect meal. However, complimentary ingredients and favourited ingredients will be suggested more frequently. Only seasonal fruits and vegetables will be suggested to encourage the user to eat seasonally.

Note: Food types are loosely defined. The original database is based on my preferences and how I tend to use certain ingredients.
